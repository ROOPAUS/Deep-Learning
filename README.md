# Deep-Learning
## Basic idea of neural network:

#### Contains 3 layers : 
Input layer, Hidden layer/layers, Output Layer

- Input Layer : Picks up input signals and passes it to next layer

- Hidden Layer/layers : Does calculation and feature extraction

- Output Layer : Delivers the final result

The interconnections/channels are assigned weights at random

These weights are multiplied with the input signal ( nodes or activations)

Finally bias is added to this weighted sum 

This weighted sum is calculated and fed to activation function in each layer to decide which nodes to fire
